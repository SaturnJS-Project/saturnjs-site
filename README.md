# About this site

SaturnJS is an effort to use Filecion Saturn CDN to power the ditribution of npm packages in developer's applications. 

The site acts as a file uploader and a npm package indexer, to allow webpack plugins like saturn-webpack-cdn-plugin to replace centralised CDNs suchs as CDNJS and UNPKG with Saturn powered deweb.link links.

Technologies used: 
* React
* Web3.Storage
* Saturn powered gateway dweb.link

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
